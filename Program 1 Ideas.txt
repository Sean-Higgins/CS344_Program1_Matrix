matrix.bash ideas.

A bash shell program designed to perform basic matrix operations. The input will come
either as a file or a stdin stream. The input is whole numbers deliminated by tabs into
a rectangular matrix.

The general format of the matrix bash file is as follows:
	matrix OPERATION [ARGUMENT] ...

Specifications: The matrix bash file must perform the following operations:
	dims (matrix dimensions), transpose (matrix transposing), mean (matrix mean),
	add (matrix addition), and multiply (matrix multiplication)

	The usage of these functions is as follows:
	
		matrix dims [MATRIX]
		matrix transpose [MATRIX]
		matrix mean [MATRIX]
		matrix add MATRIX_LEFT MATRIX_RIGHT
		matrix multiply MATRIX_LEFT MATRIX_RIGHT
	


Pseudocode:

	Matrix Valididator (Essential component for the entire bash shell)

	int rows = 0
	int collums = 0
	int errCode = 0			# I shall use the code of 0 to mean all is well.
	
	char c = ''
	str substr = ""
	int index = 0
	
	# Goes through the entire list of numbers deliminated by tabs
	# The outer loop counts rows
	while (index < len(MATRIX)):
		# The inner loop counts the number of elements in each rows
		# i.e. the number of columns. The number of elements per row MUST
		# be consistant throughout the rows.
		c = MATRIX[index]
		while (c != '/n'):
			
			if (c == '/n'):
			
			
	
	Alternate Implementation:
	
	int rows = 0
	int collums = 0
	int errCode = 0
	
	int index = 0
	
	while
	str colStr = MATRIX.split(/t)	#
	
	
	while 
		
		

	matrix dims [MATRIX]
	
	# Calls the valididator to make sure the matrix is valid.
	valid [MATRIX]
